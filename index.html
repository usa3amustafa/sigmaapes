            Long gone are the days of the crude gorilla, the brute. Shear
            strength no longer gets you a spot on the top. A new species of
            sigma APEs are now taking the lead.

            The sigma APEs reached the Digital Age 200 years before humans did.
            And they have been tracking our every move ever since. Their goal
            was not surveillance, nor was it vicious in nature.. They simply
            wanted to hide their civilization at a safe distance. Up until now.
            The sigma APEs leaders have now decided to build a Metaverse
            Ecosystem we can all thrive in.While the sigma APEs are accepting
            hundreds of thousands of visitors…
          </p>
          <p class="ready-text">
            Only the chosen 8,888 get to ascend and stay with them. The rest of
            us will get left behind. Once the sigma APEs are ready to present
            themselves in their final 3D forms, their rise to the top is
            guaranteed.
          </p>
          <p class="ready-text">
            The time sigma APE sages predicted long ago has now come.

              You’ll meet like minded friends, build real connections, and feel
              home in an Ecosystem that’s built for you. Our goal is to take
              this exclusive club of international investors and crypto
              visionaries and take over the Metaverse with them. Our focus on
              community-building was only a taste of what this is going to look
              like.

              Why, we don’t know yet. But this relic from the future carries
              great strength in itself. It’s so powerful in fact, that it
              shatters any other primates who try to touch it. Not the sigma
              APEs though. Slowly, it transforms them into something never seen
              before.

              They feel a great sense of power when they hold the relic. If the
              legends are true, those strong enough to hold their sigma APEs for
              2 months will be getting the Blue Banana Serum. Consuming this

              We are creating an entire sigma APEs Ecosystem. This includes a
              P2E game. The goal is to conquer the Jungle Kingdom in the

              The APE Games will use utility tokens that benefit holders. And
